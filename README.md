Ensure that you are using Python latest version for this tutorial with Anaconda distribution.

So now let us install Jupyter notebook, follow the steps:

If you are an existing Python user or want to install Jupyter notebook with the help of Python's package manager, then use pip instead of Anaconda.
For this you have to open a Command prompt (if Windows user) or terminal (for MAC users) and type the command:
pip3 install jupyter
or

pip install jupyter
If you are new to this field, it is highly recommended to install Anaconda first. This will at once install Python as well as Jupyter notebook and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science in your system. The official website for this is: www.jupyter.org
